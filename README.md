# **THE NINE REALMS – AN INTERACTIVE GUIDE TO OUR SOLAR SYSTEM**

**The Nine Realms** is a static web project that offers an immersive and educational tour of our solar system. 
Built entirely using **HTML** and **CSS**, this project simulates a multi-section interface where users can explore detailed information about each planet


## **FEATURES**

- Interactive sections for all nine planets, including Pluto  
- Pure CSS-based interactivity using radio buttons and label toggles  
- Planet-specific high-resolution images  
- Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers  
- Clean, semantic HTML structure with modern CSS styling 

## **HOW IT WORKS**

- Each planet is linked to a corresponding radio button and label pair  
- Only one planet section is shown at a time using CSS selectors like `:checked + .panel`  
- All functionality is achieved without the use of JavaScript or external libraries  

## **TECHNOLOGIES USED**

- **HTML5** for semantic structure  
- **CSS3** for layout, transitions, and responsiveness  

## **INSPIRATION**

The project title, **The Nine Realms**, reflects both scientific and mythological influences. It pays homage to the traditional nine-planet solar system while drawing symbolic inspiration from Norse mythology's concept of nine realms—bridging the worlds of fact and imagination.
